## **Project Title: SpecSentinel: Detecting Inconsistencies in Programming Language Specifications Using AI**

---

## **Problem Statement**

Programming language specifications (like the Java Language Specification and JVM Specification) are complex, semi-formal documents that evolve over time. They are often:

* Written in natural or semi-structured language.  
* Maintained across versions with evolving behavior.  
* Prone to **inconsistencies**, **ambiguous semantics**, or **conflicting rules** (e.g., in method resolution, generics, exception handling).

These inconsistencies can lead to:

* Misunderstandings by compiler/toolchain developers.  
* Variability in implementation across JVMs.  
* Developer confusion and subtle bugs in edge cases.

---

## **Innovation: Why This Is a Novel Idea**

While formal verification and compiler testing exist, **there is no tool that analyzes natural-language specifications themselves** for contradictions or drift across versions. This project combines:

* **NLP \+ LLMs**: To parse and semantically understand the English prose of the specification.  
* **Symbolic analysis**: To model behaviors and rules logically.  
* **Version tracking**: To detect semantic changes across Java versions (e.g., 8 → 11 → 17 → 21).  
* **Rule synthesis and contradiction detection**: Inspired by CellularLint, but for a very different domain — formal language specs.

Unlike standard linters (which operate on code), **SpecSentinel is a “linter” for specs themselves.**

## **How It Works**

### **1\. Spec Ingestion**

* Input: Java Language Specification (JLS) and JVM Specification in HTML/PDF form.  
* Preprocessing: Clean and segment the document into rules, behaviors, and constraints using NLP techniques.

### **2\. Behavior Modeling Engine**

* Extract and structure rules like:  
  * Method resolution and overloading behavior.  
  * Inheritance and overriding.  
  * Type compatibility and coercion rules.

* Use an LLM (e.g., GPT-4.5 or Claude) to assist in semantic parsing and rule translation into symbolic logic (e.g., first-order logic).

### **3\. Inconsistency Detection**

* Use a logic solver (e.g., Z3) to check for:  
  * Contradictory rules (e.g., two sections define different outcomes).  
  * Ambiguities (e.g., under-specified conditions).  
  * Redundant or unreachable rules.  
* Use graph-based visualization to show rule flows and conflicts.

### **4\. Version Drift Analyzer**

* Compare rules across JLS versions.  
* Highlight what changed and whether any previous guarantees are broken or left ambiguous.

## **Technologies to Use**

| Component | Stack/Tool |
| ----- | ----- |
| NLP Preprocessing | spaCy, NLTK, or Transformer-based models |
| LLM for Rule Understanding | OpenAI GPT-4.5 (via API) |
| Logical Rule Modeling | Prolog, Z3 SMT Solver |
| Diffing Engine | Custom text/AST diff or ChangeDistiller |
| Visualization | D3.js for rule graphs |
| Backend | Python or Node.js |
| Deployment (Optional) | Streamlit or Flask for UI |

## **Potential Impact**

* **Compiler developers** can validate spec interpretations.  
* **Language maintainers** can catch errors before release.  
* **Language learners** get a visual, formal mapping of Java behavior.  
* Extensible to **other languages** (e.g., Python, TypeScript, Solidity).  
* Paves the way for **automated spec validation** in programming language design.
